# ECSE321 Project Group 06
 Company Viewpoint of CO-OP-ERATOR



## Main Scope of the Project
There are already several co-op programs offered by McGill University, and the number of such co-op programs may increase in the future. In a co-op program, students need to take multiple semesters at companies as an integral part of their curriculum in so-called co-op terms. The scope of the software engineering group project of the Winter 2019 ECSE321 course is to develop a software system for managing co-op terms for such co-op programs. 

In a team of five students, our goal is to gather requriements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. Viewpoints (Student, Company, Co-op Administrator, and Academic manager) developed by multiple teams will be integrated with each other via service calls.
