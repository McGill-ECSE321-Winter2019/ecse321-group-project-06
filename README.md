# ECSE321 Project Group 06 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-06.svg?token=1hWgpGRW29zUadc5ySpu&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-06)
 Company Viewpoint of CO-OP-ERATOR

## Main Scope of the Project
There are already several co-op programs offered by McGill University, and the number of such co-op programs may increase in the future. In a co-op program, students need to take multiple semesters at companies as an integral part of their curriculum in so-called co-op terms. The scope of the software engineering group project of the Winter 2019 ECSE321 course is to develop a software system for managing co-op terms for such co-op programs. 

In a team of five students, our goal is to gather requriements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. Viewpoints (Student, Company, Co-op Administrator, and Academic manager) developed by multiple teams will be integrated with each other via service calls. 

Our team focuses on company (employer) viewpoint. An employer can do the following actions in the CO-OPERATOR System:
- Confirm when a student has started the co-op position
- Complete a student evaluation form as a confirmation of completion 
- download a proof of co-op placement and access taxk credit forms with instructions 
- Be notified about or invited to upcoming events

# Heroku Application
Heroku is a cloud service platform that is easy to use for many development projects. It enables application development and deployment. Heroku platform manages hardware and servers, so developer using Heroku are able to focus on perfecting their applications. With the benefit of offloading many of the concerns around application deployment and operation, our project is deloyed on Heroku.
